# Evalution-Matrix
A practical, hands-on project dedicated to exploring and implementing core evaluation metrics for machine learning models (classification and regression).

This repository serves as a working reference guide and script collection to help users deeply understand what a metric measures and when to apply it.

Key Focus Areas:
Classification: Implementation of $\text{Precision}$, $\text{Recall}$, $\text{F1-Score}$, $\text{ROC-AUC}$, and interpretation of the Confusion Matrix.
Regression: Calculation and comparison of $\text{MSE}$ (Mean Squared Error), $\text{RMSE}$, and $\text{MAE}$ (Mean Absolute Error).
Imbalance Handling: Scripts demonstrating the use of metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets.
